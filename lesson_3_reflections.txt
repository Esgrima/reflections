When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
So it's accessible from anywhere in the event you don't have access to local.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Privacy concerns, it may not be ready, you maybe using a device that is not yours and you do not want files on that device.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
It is available in the event you need it for any reason.
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Easier: Cant think of anything. Harder: Wouldn't be able to visualize the changes done by different people and when exactly each change was done.
When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
If it hasn't been decided that the changes will be part of the master. Making changes directly to master is quick, but doing so in a separate branch protects the master from breaking.
