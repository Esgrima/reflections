What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It will now show up on Git. The user will now be capable of executing Git commands and use Git features on/with the repository.
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is the transition area where you choose which files are to be committed from the working directory and once committed they will show up in the repository as a commit. It offers the ability to go back and change, add, or remove files to commit before committing.
