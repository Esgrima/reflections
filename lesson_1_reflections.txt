How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
The diff lists when the two versions are different, and it enables you to see errors such as typos.
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
It saves you a lot of time without having to rewrite hundreds of line.
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
You'll have less and more logical versions with Git, but you have to regularly save.
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Some projects require multiple files that are interdependent. Hence, if one file is not tracked or updated, the project or program will not work.
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log lists all of the commits and git diff allows you to compare two commits and it'll label the insertions and withdrawals
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
You can always go back to a previous version with git checkout.
Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Everything?
